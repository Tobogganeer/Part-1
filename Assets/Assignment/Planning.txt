Chosen: Spacewar-esque game

Features to plan: player, asteroids, missiles, black hole, borders

Player.cs:
- Accelerates with W/S, rotates with A/D
- Shoots missiles with space
- Physics based (has a Rigidbody2D), and will coast around (like space)
- Has a collider for detecting collisions
- Destroyed on impact with an asteroid
- Will have a BlackHoleObject script once it is created (to get pulled towards black hole)
- Destroyed on being sucked into black hole
- Pseudocode:
  - Variables for the rb, speed, rotation speed, fire rate, fire timer, input
  - Set callback for being sucked into black hole (destroy ourselves)
  - Store input and check for missile launches in Update
  - Instantiate a missile if the timer is low enough and space is pressed
  - Apply forces and torque in FixedUpdate
  - Detect asteroid collision in OnCollisionEnter2D (check tag) and destroy if colliding with an asteroid

Asteroid.cs:
- Physics objects (rigidbody) with a collider
- Instantiated outside of screen, flying towards the center
- Have randomized size
- Spins slightly over time
- Will be affected by black hole
- Destroyed by player missiles (perhaps with a little effect)
- Destroyed after some time (will be after it has left the screen)
- Destroyed upon being sucked into black hole
- Pseudocode
  - Variables for the rb, angular velocity, lifetime
  - Set callback for being sucked into black hole explode)
  - Rotates and decrements lifetime in Update
  - Exploding due to missiles is handled by missiles
  - Function Explode()
