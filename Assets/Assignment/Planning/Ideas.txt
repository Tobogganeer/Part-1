Infinite driving/car game
- Procedurally generated path (instantiation)
- Car controls with physics
- Triggers for generating new sections & score
- Collision for detecting crashes (and other cars maybe)
- Abilities (kinda like mario kart) that use kinematic motion (missiles or smth)

Mini golf
- Ball moves with physics
- Course obstacles are kinematic
- Trigger for hole
- Wall collision instantiates effects (homebrew particles)
- Wall collision also makes ball bounce (are physics materials allowed? not a component, but material is on the list...)

Space game (spacewar?)
- Physics ship
- Kinematic missiles and asteroids
- Asteroids are instantiated
- Collision hit for missiles
- Trigger for going out of screen area + black hole in middle?

Ping pong thingy with powers
- Kinematic paddles
- Physics based ball
- Collision for paddles/wall
- Trigger for powerups/abilities
